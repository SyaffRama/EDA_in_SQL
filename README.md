# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project — MySQL

# Overview
This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using MySQL to understand the structure, quality, and patterns within a dataset. The goal is to demonstrate how SQL can be used to explore data, uncover trends, and generate insights before any advanced analysis or modeling is conducted.

This project highlights practical SQL skills commonly required in data analyst roles.

# Dataset
- Source: Structured relational dataset
- Format: SQL tables
- Content: Contains multiple fields suitable for aggregation, filtering, and descriptive analysis

Note: The dataset is used strictly for exploration, not transformation or modeling

# Tools
- MySQL

# Steps
The EDA process includes:
- Reviewing table structure and column data types
- Exploring row counts and basic statistics
- Checking for missing or null values
- Analyzing distributions using aggregations
- Identifying patterns, trends, and outliers
- Comparing values across categories using GROUP BY and WHERE clauses

All analysis is performed using SQL queries.

# Results
- Gained a clear understanding of the dataset’s structure and content
- Identified key trends and summary metrics
- Highlighted potential data quality issues and areas for further analysis
- Produced insights that can support downstream analytics or reporting
